In this study, we want to learn more about how children choose what to play, and how they creatively exercise their imagination.",

Additionally, your child may only participate in this study once in order to be eligible for compensation. There may be multiple versions of this study posted over time, but only your first participation will count for compensation. However, even if you do not finish the whole study or we are not able to use your child's data, we will still send a gift card! There are no other direct benefits to you or your child from participating, but we hope you will enjoy the experience.",

However, researchers are still studying how play behaviors develop, and how play affects children's learning and development. Because play is so variable across individual children, it can be tricky to carefully measure and study how children think and make decisions during play.\n\nIn this research, we look at which objects children choose to play pretend with. Do children prefer objects that offer more possibilities for imagining with? Or do they prefer objects that they can very quickly imagine as something else, even if they can only think of one idea?\n\nTo answer these questions, we ran two related tasks in this study. Part 1 measured which objects children prefer. Part 2 measured what ideas children come up with. By combining the data from both tasks, we can better understand how children think about pretend possibilities, and how children choose what to play with. We are also interested in how children's pretend play relates to other aspects of their development, such as language and age."
